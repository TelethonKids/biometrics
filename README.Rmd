# Telethon Kids Institute R markdown templates

A pair of templates have been created that incorporate styling themes present throughout Telethon Kid’s style guide, web page and template documents. Currently, templates are available to produce stand-alone HTML reports and ioslides presentations. These templates also include colour palates that will automatically reproduce Telethon Kids style in R graphics. A number of helper functions and data-sets are also available.

## Getting started

### Installing

These templates are included in the *biometrics* R package (the current version is found [here](O:\Biostats\05_resources\2018)) and can be installed *via* the "Install From: Package Archive File" option in R Studio.

### Creating an new document

Once the *biometrics* package has been installed, the templates can be accessed through the *New -> R markdown -> From template* menu.

## Using the template

Both templates have been created with R markdown and the normal syntax should be followed. Some specific instructions and examples are included in default documents. A cheat-sheet explaining how to use markdown in R has been prepared by [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
