    - Linear regression `lm()` [@CiteR]
        + $y \sim mx + b$
        + where, ***XXX***
* Research Question 2
    - Linear regression `glm()` [@CiteR]
        + $y \sim mx + b$
        + where, ***XXX***

Statistical models will be prepared for the dependant measures identified above with some commentary regarding their interpretation and statistical significance in terms of 95% confidence intervals. Where appropriate, figures will be prepared to help convey the analysis findings. Descriptive statistics can also be provided in the final result/manuscript preparation upon request.

Commentary around the methods and results of model creation will be provided in the form of a report that will include bullet point overviews of model preparation and results. Once specific analysis outcomes have been identified by the project sponsor for inclusion in publishable works, "copy-and-paste" paragraphs for manuscript preparation and a more detailed analysis summary can be provided. The analysis and reporting will be completed in the R programming language and all R script files associated with the analysis will be made available to the researcher upon request.

# Analysis Estimate

Assuming the data are tidy and clean, we estimate <mark>4-6 days of analysis time</mark> (at $900 per day, excluding GST), which does not include final result preparation time. Up to two Biometrics Biostatisticians to be included as authors on resulting publication(s) (assuming sufficient academic contributions are made).

It would be worthwhile preparing a skeleton of the tables for the paper to make the most efficient use of the analysis time, as working through multiple iterations of possible tables (which we are happy to do if required) will increase the analysis time/cost.

Final table preparation and contribution to paper writing, within reason, is provided in-kind. Cost recovery for this function will be necessary if there are substantial edits/revisions/changes-of-mind.
