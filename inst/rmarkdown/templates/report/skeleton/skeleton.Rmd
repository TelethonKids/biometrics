# Overview

***XXX*** from the ***XXX Research Team*** is looking to engage in consultation with the Telethon Kids Institute's Biometrics team to undertake statistical analysis to determine ***brief project summary***.

***Study overview to put the analysis in context - copy from the analysis plan.***

## Research Questions

1.  Research Question 1
2.  Research Question 2

# Summary of Findings

***Brief paragraph(s) that could be copy/pasted by the researcher into a manuscript, more detailed analysis is provided in the "commentary" section below.***

# Research Question 1

## Tables

```{r, table = TRUE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
head(mtcars)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
export_summs(mods$mtcars, error_format = "CI [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]", model.names = "mtcars", exp = FALSE)

```

## Figures

### Raw Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.extra = "figure", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp, group = cyl, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Iris Data")

```

### Model Outcomes

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.extra = "figure", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot_summs(mods$mtcars, model.names = "mtcars")

```

## Notes

* Linear regression [@CiteR]
    - $y \sim mx + b$
* The reported effect estimates have ***not*** been exponentiated
* Effect estimates, 95% confidence intervals that include 0 indicated there was insufficient evidence to establish statistical significance
* ***Key observations...***
    
## Conclusion

***One or 2 sentences to summarise the analysis of Research Question 1.***

# Commentary

***Detailed description of analysis outcomes that the project sponsor can use to copy into their report/manuscript.***
