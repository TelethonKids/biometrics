# Overview

***XXX*** from the ***XXX Research Team*** is looking to engage in consultation with the Telethon Kids Institute's Biometrics team to undertake statistical analysis to determine ***brief project summary***.

## Inclusion Criteria

* ***Age < 18 years old***
* ***Scores > 20***
* ***...***

## Data Variables Overview

### Key Variables

* ***XXX*** could not be found in the provided data, could ***XXX*** please provide some insight

# Analysis Plan

* Research Question 1
    - Linear regression `lm()` [@CiteR]
        + $y \sim mx + b$
        + where, ***XXX***
* Research Question 2

Statistical models will be prepared for the dependant measures identified above with some commentary regarding their interpretation and statistical significance in terms of 95% confidence intervals. Where appropriate, figures will be prepared to help convey the analysis findings.

Commentary around the methods and results of model creation will be provided in the form of a report with bullet-point summaries of the analysis procedures and results. The analysis and reporting will be completed in the R programming language and all R script files associated with the analysis will be made available to the researcher upon request.

# Analysis Estimate

The Telethon Clinical Research Centre (TCRC) provides 7.5 hours of biostatistical support. A TCRC biostatistician will carry out analysis for this project and will notify the project sponsor when the analysis reaches 7.5 hours; any further analysis, should it be required, will be completed on a cost-recovery basis at a rate of $875 per day, excluding GST. Up to two Biometrics Biostatisticians to be included as authors on resulting publication(s) (assuming sufficient academic contributions are made).

# Summary of Findings

## Tables

```{r, table = TRUE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
head(mtcars)

```

```{r model_1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
export_summs(mods$mtcars, error_format = "CI [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]", model.names = "mtcars", exp = FALSE)

```

## Figures

### Raw Data

```{r figure 1-1, echo = FALSE, out.extra = "figure", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp, group = cyl, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Iris Data")

```

### Model Outcomes

```{r figure_1-1, echo = FALSE, out.extra = "figure", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot_summs(mods$mtcars, model.names = "mtcars")

```

## Notes

* Linear regression [@CiteR]
    - $y \sim mx + b$
* The reported effect estimates have ***not*** been exponentiated
* Effect estimates, 95% confidence intervals that include 0 indicated there was insufficient evidence to establish statistical significance
* ***Key observations...***
    - `r filter(quick_text(mods), term == "Sepal.Width")$text1`

## Conclusion

***One or 2 sentences to summarise the analysis.***
